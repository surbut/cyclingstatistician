===================

Learning, biking, repeating. Not necessarily in that order. And trying not to destroy the cluster.
I keep an updated collection of my developing understanding of Bayesian statistics, computer programming, and human genetics. Sadly the bicycling shows far less progress, so not too much to comment on there. Enjoy!
