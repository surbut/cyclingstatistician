* Tasks
** TODO Update on completed effect size document and .Rmd file
** TODO Introduce to the organization on the cluster
** TODO Talk about implementing type model and tabix/file structure:
   vcf-->bed file. Where are gene and SNP coordinates?
   I'm really having trouble getting the file structure appropriate
   to implement Tim's model, and it's difficult to get computer help
   from abroad. I think I might learn more if I could work with
   someone with some experience on this matter temporarily>
** TODO Thesis project: More stats vs. genetics, or am I a data person?
